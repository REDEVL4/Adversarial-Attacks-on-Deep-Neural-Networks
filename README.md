# Adversarial-Attacks-on-Deep-Neural-Networks
This project investigates both adversarial attacks and defensive strategies for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). While adversarial examples exploit vulnerabilities in models by introducing imperceptible perturbations, defensive methods aim to improve robustness and ensure reliable predictions.
